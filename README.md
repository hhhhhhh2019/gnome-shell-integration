# GNOME Shell Integration for Kando

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code in the `main` branch is for GNOME Shell 45+. For older GNOME versions, please use the `gnome-40-44` branch.

This GNOME Shell extension is required for [ü•ß Kando](https://github.com/kando-menu/kando) on GNOME under Wayland.
Via a D-Bus interface, it provides the name of the currently focused window, and the current mouse pointer position.
Furthermore, it allows registering and simulating keyboard shortcuts.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

### From the GNOME Extensions Website

Just head over to [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7068/kando-integration/) and flip the switch to install the extension!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kando-menu/gnome-shell-integration.git

```

Afterwards, restart GNOME Shell by logging out and back in.
